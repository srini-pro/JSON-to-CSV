Json what a lovly file but oh no!
nothing can show json well .
So Csv are good targets since ;
1 they are useable in all speard sheet software
2 they're used in ai,
3 its simple 
so a  50 ish word on how its works
the python sees the inputted json changeed all the " ' " and " } " / "{" in to null
and : into comma
and renames the file
